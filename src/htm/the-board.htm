					The board is the people in the antenna that on their free time take on the tasks needed to run the organisation and keep it alive. These tasks are replying to messages, fill reports, create promotional material and organise events. At the moment our board is composed of three people: the president, the treasurer and the secretary.

				Become member of the board
			</h2>
			<p class="dropcap">
				Being member of the board means to devote a bit of your free time to help to run our lovely antenna. We know that you're bussy studing or working full-time. We'll provide you with information and help in your role at the board. Knowledge transfer is a very important step for the right working of the antenna.
			</p>
			<p class="Mt(1vw) Pt(6vw)--mo">
				In order to become member of the board:
			</p>
			<ul class="Mt(0.5vw)">
				<li class="Pt(2vw)--mo">
					You need to know what is AEGEE. You need to have been member of some AEGEE antenna previously for at least 6 months.
				</li>
				<li class="Pt(2vw)--mo">
					You want and have the time to be commited to AEGEE-London and make sure you carry out the tasks assigned to your board position.
				</li>
				<li class="Pt(2vw)--mo">
					Some board position must be vacant.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Mt(1vw) Pt(2vw)--mo">
				<span class="b">You don't need to be member of the board to put your two cents</span>. If you don't want to be so commited yet want to help, by just having friends or contacts which would be happy to become member of AEGEE-London and you let them know about our local events, that would be a very good way to contribute.

				We were born the <span class="b">15<span class="sup">th</span> of January 2013</span> as the AEGEE-Europe Contact in London. During the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SpringAgoraRheinNeckar2013" target="_blank">Spring Agora Rhein Neckar</a>, on Saturday 6<span class="sup">th</span> April 2013 we signed our <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B16wwN1jG4T2UVBSV2h4UE1VTGs" target="_blank">Convention d’Adhésion</a> with AEGEE-Europe becoming then a Contact Antenna.

Eszter Bangó (first antenna's president, the blond girl behind the lectern on the above picture) and Maarten Veldmans (one of the founders, on the pic holding the microphone) attended the Agora in Mannheim, to sign the Convention.

				Previous AEGEE-London foundations
			</h2>
			<p class="dropcap">
				2013 wasn't the first time AEGEE-London was <a href="http://www.zeus.aegee.org/magazine/2013/02/26/new-contact-in-london-promoting-multiculturalism-in-britain" target="_blank">founded</a>. The first time that AEGEE-London was really born was in 1985/1986 (do you know the exact date? We don't). It existed until at least 1995 (we have a t-shirt of AEGEE-London of that year). However, afterwards, it died. Just until 2013, when it reborn from the ashes to become again a wonderful antenna.

				During the 3rd Comité Directeur board (November 1986 to November 1987), <a href="https://www.aegeegoldentimes.eu/all-aegee-cds" target="_blank">Andrew Oldland</a>, from our antenna, was Treasurer at the CD.
