			AEGEE-London is the perfect place if what you want is to know students and young workers who enjoy the incredible city of London and share the common belief of a united and open Europe. Our main activities are social drinks, day trips to places around London and exchanges with other antennae. This city has a high density of classy and old English pubs where a pint of beer or cider can be afforded even by the tightest millennial budgets.

			International events are at the heart of AEGEE. Our Identity reflects five different means: Intercultural exchange, personal development and non-formal education, thematic projects, policy and advocacy and forum for discussion. During conferences, exchanges, trainings and many other events, students have the opportunity to meet and to exchange their opinions, ideas, and impressions on various topics. These events are organised by AEGEE locals, Working Groups, or projects, often based on a cooperation among these bodies.

			<p>
				Summer Universities take place during summer between one and two weeks in many cities where AEGEE is present. Understanding and exploring the multicultural dimension of the European continent, removing national borders, fighting for tolerance and creating open-minded citizens are some of the reasons why 20 to 50 young Europeans from all over Europe come together to taste the diversity of multiculturalism.

			<p class="Pt(4%) Pt(6vw)--mo">
				In a Summer University you will be given the chance to taste different food, listen and dance to unusual music, befriend people from many countries and then arranging trips with them. You will learn to say "hi" in another 10 languages, experience, enjoy and love new things… You will discover the real AEGEE spirit!

			</p>
			<p class="Pt(4%) Pt(6vw)--mo">
				The main discussions and decisions take place during the plenary meetings. The participants of the Agora also join workshops, prytania (to discuss changes to the statutes of the organisation), progress meetings about ongoing projects, and other programmes.
