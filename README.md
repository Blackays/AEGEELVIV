We're the local branch of AEGEE in London. We were born in 2013 and since then we've striven to run a local group of pro-European enthusiastic students and workers who enjoy spending time together.

[AEGEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEGEE) stands for Association des États Généraux des Étudiants de l'Europe and it is known as European Students' Forum in English. It is the largest trans-national, interdisciplinary student organisation in Europe. Established in 1985, AEGEE currently has around 13,000 members and almost 200 local branches (antennae) in university cities across Europe, including Russia, Turkey and the Caucasus, with a European board and head office in Brussels.

AEGEE strives for a democratic, diverse and borderless Europe, which is socially, economically and politically integrated, and values the participation of young people in its construction and development. AEGEE is a secular, non-profit organization, not linked to any political party. All projects and activities are based on voluntarily work of its members. AEGEE empowers students and young people in Europe to take an active role in society by influencing political decision makers, and it creates a space for dialogue and learning opportunities.
