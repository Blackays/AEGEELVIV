# AEGEE-London website

Repository for the AEGEE-London [website](https://aegee-london.eu).

The website is vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS bundled with Gulp. It doesn't use any toolset or front-end framework like jQuery, Angular or React. It's served statically from [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), hosting service with no costs. We don't make use of any CMS. No WordPress, Wix or similar. The [`docs`](https://github.com/AntonioRedondo/aegee-london.eu/tree/master/docs) folder is the final distributable page that is delivered when visiting [`aegee-london.eu`](https://aegee-london.eu). GitHub Pages allows to use your [own custom domain](https://help.github.com/en/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages). We pay ~10â‚¬ a year for the `aegee-london.eu` domain on [GoDaddy](http://godaddy.com).

If you're the IT responsible for your antenna, you like our website and you'd like to use it, feel free to fork the repo, make the necessary changes and republish the website for your own antenna. It would be the best honour for [Tony](https://github.com/AntonioRedondo), the responsible for our site. Please remember to leave the footer with the link to the original repo and the link to [Tony's GitHub](https://github.com/AntonioRedondo).
